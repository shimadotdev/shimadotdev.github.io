If you take a look at existing Dockerfiles, you will see sample commands like RUN apt-get install something; these commands allow us to install necessary packages for running software in an isolated container environment, assign ports, or define directories.</description>

      <description>Usually, when we enter new work environments, it can be challenging to present ourselves in the right and suitable light, especially if our work experience or abilities are unclear to others, and this becomes even more difficult when you are a woman in the tech field!&#xA;About four years ago, I was introduced and invited to work at my current company through the recommendation of a former colleague (Hello Khani).
