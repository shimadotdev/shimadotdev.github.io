      <description>Imagine you have a personal user account on GitLab with the email yourname@gmail.com, and now you&amp;rsquo;ve been hired by a company. You need to connect to GitLab with the email account they provided for you (yourname@company.com). If you&amp;rsquo;ve previously added your system&amp;rsquo;s public key for your personal account and SSH connection, you may encounter an error when trying to add the same key for the company&amp;rsquo;s GitLab account. This error informs you that the key has already been added because GitLab doesn&amp;rsquo;t allow using a common SSH public key across two different user accounts.</description>
